All the code from the UCSD on Coursera Course: Advanced Data Structures in Java

Primarily studied graphs and algorithms to work with/explore graphs. Project involved writing backend code to search maps for paths from place to place: bfs, dijkstra's and A*.
I added an extension to the app to find a reasonable solution to the traveling salesman problem, using a greedy algorithm. Only the backend code, though. GUI still needs to be reworked to incorporate my extension code.
